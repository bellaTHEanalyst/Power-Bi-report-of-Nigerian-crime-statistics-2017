## Solution 

-  Crime is an illegal act for which someone can be punished by the government. especially : a gross violation of law. : a grave offense especially against morality.

- Criminal statistics are based on notifiable (triable by jury) recorded offences, and can be drawn from aggregate data recorded by official agencies such as the police and courts, but also from criminological research studies.
- crime statistic is useful for understanding macro crime patterns. For comparison with previous years to discover trends in crime. To look at the police clear-up rate to measure police efficiency. To show where the police should concentrate resources to reduce crime.
