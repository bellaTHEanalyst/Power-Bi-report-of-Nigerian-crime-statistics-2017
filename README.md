## Problem Statement

1.	What is crime?
2.	What is criminal statistics?
3.	What is the usefulness of crime statistics?
## Analysis 1
- What region has the highest offence rate by offense category? 
- 	What is the rate of offence by offence category in each geopolitical zone?
## Analysis 2

## Solution 

-  Crime is an illegal act for which someone can be punished by the government, in a simple language it is an act that is unlawful, and such unlawful act is punishable by a government or an authority.

- Criminal statistics are based on notifiable (triable by jury) recorded offences, and can be drawn from aggregate data recorded by official agencies such as the police and courts, but also from criminological research studies.
- 
- crime statistic is useful for understanding macro crime patterns. For comparison with previous years to discover trends in crime. To look at the police clear-up rate to measure police efficiency. To show where the police should concentrate resources to reduce crime.

## Analysis 1

I created a report  to answer the problem statement and i inserted slicer which  helps  filter out some specific data from a report.

## Reccomendations

- Engage Youths On Positive Ventures
It is said that, the idle individual is a devil workshop, going by this fact, it is therefore, important to have youths engaged in positive and profitable ventures.The youths within the neighborhood should have themselves in positive ventures, during their spare time, such spare time should be invested in things such as, recreation /exercise and tutoring programs and part-time work, and volunteer opportunities, etc.

- Set Up Community Patrol
You should be security conscious. In your neighborhood you can organized what I called ‘ community patrol’, to watch dog your neighborhood.
There is even what they called ‘neighborhood watch’, organize such group and have them work with police. And take note, lighting your streets and homes, even your neighborhood is of advantage

- Emphasize Crime Prevention
Emphasize crime prevention in your local neighborhood, make sure that schools, and the law enforcement agencies, and the public health agencies, and libraries, even other workplaces, including religious institutions, plus that of child protective agencies, and others such agencies within your neighborhood are working assiduously to ensure that, crimes are prevented, they should not necessarily react to crime or, violence.What is expected of them is the kind of policies they have put in place to ensure that, crime, if not prevented, should be reduced to its bearest minimum. 

## Conclusion
Crime in the society is forbidden and it is punishable as well, by law, reason is because when once crime is committed, or there is criminal offence, it is simply an act that is harmful to either an individual or some individuals, it could be harmful to either community or society, even to a state. Many have come to agree that, crime is a public wrong, and it could as well, be private wrong depending on which angle you view it.
